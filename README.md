#UCD Lost and Found
By Steven Tan and Ruifeng Zhang

Fully Functional, with everything implemented. Desktop view was not provided in the google drive, so we manually designed it to what looked best (assuming the images was mobile view).
Added a few extra buttons so indivduals can navagate through easier. UCD Logo takes you back to screen 3. The location that Google Maps gives us is the physical address and thats what we give to the users (Example: Modavi Center, 523 Mrak Hall Dr, Davis, CA 95616. Will be displayed as 523 Mrak Hall)

Overall very fun and enjoyable project, good learning experiance. Thank You
